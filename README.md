# rock-paper-scissors

To play Rock Paper Scissors, please clone the repository, navigate to the directory that the 
repository resides in and run the following command:

```python3 rock-paper-scissors.py```

This will start the Flask server. Once the server is up and running on your local machine, 
open a web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. This is the home page of the 
game, but not the game itself. A future improvement would be to continue to buff out this home page
to make it chic and feature-full.

To play Rock Paper Scissors, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/match`. Once there, your game will
have already commenced! You are Player 1 and your opponent is the computer. Select one of the
buttons under Player 1's name (unfortunately Apple doesn't have a rock emoji so we are actually
playing Rock Climbing Paper Scissors) to make your move. Good luck! May the rock climber be with you.

A tiny bit of technical details... This was built up using Flask and Python as a backend with HTML/CSS/JS
handling the frontend magic.

Thank you GWC for taking the time to review my application and play my version of Rock Paper Scissors.
